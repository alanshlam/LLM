The network diagram depicts a simple network architecture with three primary components: the internet, a firewall/server, and a client. The internet is represented by a cloud symbol, while the firewall/server and client are depicted as boxes.

**Network Components:**

*   Internet (cloud)
*   Firewall/Server
*   Client

**Connections:**

*   Internet → Firewall/Server
*   Firewall/Server → Client

**IP Addresses/Subnets:**

*   No IP addresses or subnets are visible in the diagram.

**Protocols/Services:**

*   No specific protocols or services are indicated in the diagram.

**Labels/Annotations:**

*   The firewall/server is labeled as "Firewall/Server."
*   The client is labeled as "Client."

In summary, the network diagram shows a basic network setup with an internet connection, a firewall/server, and a client. The connections between these components are straightforward, with the internet connecting to the firewall/server and the firewall/server connecting to the client. There are no visible IP addresses or subnets, and no specific protocols or services are indicated. The labels and annotations provide clear identification of the different components in the network.
